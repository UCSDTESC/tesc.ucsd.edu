            </div>
            <div className="about__text text-center">
                TESC, or Triton Engineering Student Council, is a UCSD org that advocates opportunities for undergrad engineering students. We are made of several different engineering clubs, from organizations that specialize in different areas of engineering, to project and building teams, and more! We also host large scale events such as SDHacks, Engineers on the Green, and more to provide collaboration and networking opportunities to engineering students.

            </div>
            <div className="about__text text-center">
                TESC provides a number of opportunities to engineering clubs and organizations. Active TESC orgs are given funding to host engineering events, access to event planning software, and the ability to collaborate with other TESC orgs and outside businesses. Overall, TESC provides social networking and financial support to orgs that may be hard to gain as a stand-alone org.

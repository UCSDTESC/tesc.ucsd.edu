                    <p>
                        TESC allocates funds to orgs on a yearly cycle. Orgs
                        should expect to receive an email with an amount
                        allocated to them by the end of week 7, FA20. If your
                        organization fails to join the funding cycle before the
                        week 5 deadline, there will be no way of receiving TESC
                        funds until next year.

                    <p>
                        WE ENCOURAGE EVERY ORG TO JOIN THE TESC FUNDING CYCLE.
                        Even if you’re not sure you will need funding at any
                        point during the year, we can still set aside part of
                        our funding for your org!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By joining the cycle, your org will receive a portion of
                        the TESC Org Fund. You will still need to submit funding
                        requests per event/project as before, and follow the
                        guidelines. If your event is eligible for funding, you
                        can be sure that you will receive up to the amount
                        allocated to you. For example, if org A is allocated
                        $1,500, they will need to submit for Event A funding for
                        $800. If Event A follows funding guidelines, the
                        proposal will be accepted, and TESC will fund that event
                        for $800. If they want to fund Event B for another $800,
                        TESC will fund up to $700 (if Event B is eligible)
                        guaranteed.

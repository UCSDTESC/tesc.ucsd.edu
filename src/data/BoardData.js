      "I am a fourth-year bioengineering: biotechnology major and next year's President for TESC. I am really excited to work with such a great team this year and see how we’re able to build upon our previous success. This year will be a lot different than past ones, especially with the challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19, but I think this will be a catalyst for innovation and new ideas. As President, I want to be a resource and help support TESC’s wonderful board members, committees, and council orgs in any way I can. Outside of TESC, I enjoy baking, going to the beach, and playing with my pet bunnies, Marshmallow and Blueberry!",

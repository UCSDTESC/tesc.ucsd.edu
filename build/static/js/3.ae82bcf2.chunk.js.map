Also, I like constantly challenging myself, aiming for a better self every day. In my free time, I enjoy TV shows, food hunting and travelling.\",\n        link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/fengbo-xia/'\n    },\n    {\n        name: 'Cameron Wilkinson',\n        role: 'Council Relations Lead',\n        img: 'https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tesc-website/board/council-lead.jpg',\n        email: 'cameron@tesc.ucsd.edu',\n        bio: '4th year mechanical engineering major with a passion to solve problems.
